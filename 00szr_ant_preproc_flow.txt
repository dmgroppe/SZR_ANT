0. For the patients I manually marked, find onset channel and get a sense of how focal the onsets are by running something like:
python plot_manual_onset_times.py NA

It creates pdfs of the relative szr onsets at all channels.

Indicate onset channel in chans_of_interest.csv


1. Move the EEG data to /Users/davidgroppe/ONGOING/TWH_EEG
mat files go in EEG_MAT, text files of data in EEG_TXT
channel info simply goes in the subject’s root directory


2. Create chan label csv file via: create_chan_label_csv_file.ipynb


3. Create csv files of clinician onsets via:
*create_skeleton_onset.ipynb: Makes a draft of a clinician onset csv file based on raw data text files
*manually enter seizure onsets and offsets from Sumayya’s spreadsheet:
*Run onset_time2tpts.ipynb to add additional columns (e.g., when the onset is)

4. Fill out DG_ONSET_CHAN column of the CSV file created in step 3 with a guess as to what the onset channel is. You can edit these after plotting spectrograms in Step 5.

5. Plot clinician onsets to make sure they concur with onset in the target channel by running something like:
plot_onsets_on_sgrams.py NA

Fill out the column USE4CLASSIFIER with “use” if the data are usable. If not, provide the reason (e.g., noEEGdata, clinicianOnsetTooEarly)



*. Target stimulation window is 4 seconds before clinician onset until 9 seconds after clinician onset. Note that due to rounding, exact timing of clinician onset is +/- 2 seconds.
