0. For the patients I manually marked, find onset channel and get a sense of how focal the onsets are by running something like:
python plot_manual_onset_times.py NA

It creates pdfs of the relative szr onsets at all channels.

Indicate onset channel in chans_of_interest.csv


1. Move the EEG data to /Users/davidgroppe/ONGOING/TWH_EEG
mat files go in EEG_MAT, text files of data in EEG_TXT
channel info simply goes in the subject’s root directory


2. Create chan label csv file via: create_chan_label_csv_file.ipynb


3. Create csv files of clinician onsets via:
*create_skeleton_onset.ipynb: Makes a draft of a clinician onset csv file based on raw data text files
*manually enter seizure onsets and offsets from Sumayya’s spreadsheet:
*Run onset_time2tpts.ipynb to add additional columns (e.g., when the onset is)


4. Plot clinician onsets to make sure they concur with onset in the target channel by running something like:
plot_onsets_on_sgrams.py NA

Fill out the column USE4CLASSIFIER with “use” if the data are usable. If not, provide the reason (e.g., noEEGdata, clinicianOnsetTooEarly)


5. Run ?? classification algorithm
